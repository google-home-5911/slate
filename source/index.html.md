# Introduction

Welcome to the working documentation for the Nationwide Conversational Assistant "Nationwide Life". The following sections 
describe the collective functionality of the application. This includes its technology stack, architecture, methods, and datebase structure,
and any other additional notes we found important to pass on to the next team of developers. 

# Notable Project Files

## app.py
The majority of the logic (code) for the project. Methods for app.py are listed in the App.py Methods section.

## db.py
Where all database queries are run. These queries are within the functions. Each of these functions either returns some piece of data or updates the database. They are then used in app.py methods.

## db_build.py
Constructs the Sqlite3 database. Reads from the excel file <code>Tables.xlsx</code>, which consists of the db tables in excel form, to perform the build. This allows for easy editing of tables and attributes. This file is ran locally

## db_build_remote.py
Same as <code>db_build.py</code> except ran from Google Home during the reset database intent. 

## NW.DB
The raw database file. Can be viewed with Firefox sqlite plugin (available for verions 42 and above) or any other sqlite3 management application. 

## Procfile
The mechanism for declaring what commands are run by your applicationâ€™s dynos on the Heroku platform.
For the purposes of this project, Heroku will only need to execute the command <code>python.app.py</code> through web. 
Read more [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile)

## requirements.txt
A list of dependencies for the project. Run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to automatically install
these dependencies.

## setup.py
In the command line, in the same directory as your <code>setup</code> folder, run python setup.py to properly install xlrd, the Excel reader for database builds. 

## Tables.xlsx

The Excel file representation of the database. Xlrd reads from this file in <code>db_build.py</code> to build the database, creating <code>NW.db</code>

## Test.py
The python file where automated unit tests are ran.

# Agile Artifacts


# App.py Methods

Methods related to the app's immediate functional requirements are located in app.py. These methods are as follows:

## webhook


```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import request, redirect, session, url_for, make_response, render_template


@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    req = request.get_json(silent=True, force=True)

    print(json.dumps(req, indent=4))

    res = processRequest(req)
    res = json.dumps(res, indent=4)

    r = make_response(res)
    r.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    return r
```


This endpoint gets and parses the JSON generated from Dialogflow after an action is triggered. 


### HTTP Request

`POST http:/testnw2.herokuapp.com/webhook`

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
include_cats | false | If set to true, the result will also include cats.
available | true | If set to false, the result will include kittens that have already been adopted.


## processRequest




This endpoint processes the JSON request that we received from Dialogflow. In that JSON request exists a specific action that corresponds to what intent was triggered in Dialogflow. We map said action to a specific function within our webhook. 

<aside class="warning">If no function exists for the given function, nothing will happen.</aside>


### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
req | The request JSON received from Dialogflow to be processed





## obtainThyCredentials

```python
 event = service.events().insert(calendarId='primary', body=event).execute()
```
Grants access to the Google Calendar API by storing an access token within the project directory. If no access token is found, it will 
run an authentication flow in order to obtain said token. See [Google API Client Secrets Flow](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_client_secrets) for more information. For the purposes of the demo, in order to obtain the access token for a given you, run the script under "shell" to the right in a command line. A browser window will appear for you to authenticate. 


<aside class="success">
After authenticating in the browser window once, you will not need to do so again unless you wish to authenticate another user. 
</aside>

        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }
```

Pays either one type of insurance plan, or all plans the user is enrolled in, provided whatever the user voices. 
If payment is successful, updates database with new values for the checking account after a given payment is made. If the user does not have the
necessary amount in their checking account, the payment will not be made, and the method will return a notice message. 
If a certain payment has already been made, the method will alert the user that they have already made that payment.

### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
req | The request JSON. We obtain parameters <code>userID</code> and <code>insurance_type</code> from the request.

<br> 


## lifeInsurancePolicy

```python
def lifeInsurancePolicy(req):
    parameters = req.get("result").get("parameters")
    userID = int(parameters.get("userID"))

    overallROR = getOverallReturnRate(userID)
    lastMonthROR = getLastMonthReturnRate(userID)
    internationInvestment = getInternationInvestment(userID)
    internationalROR = getInternationalROR(userID)

    rorDifference = lastMonthROR - overallROR
   
    if rorDifference < 0:
        #speech = "Your return rate has decreased by " + str(rorDifference) + " percent over the past month relative to your overall rate of return. You have invested " + str(internationInvestment) + " dollars in international markets, this having a rate of return of " + str(internationalROR) + " percent."
        speech = "The cash value of your policy has been decreasing in value. Would you like to hear more information?"
    else:
        #speech = "Your return rate has increased by " + str(rorDifference) + " percent over the past month relative to your overall rate of return. You have invested " + str(internationInvestment) + " dollars in international markets, this having a rate of return of " + str(internationalROR) + " percent."
        speech = "The cash value of your policy has increased in value. Would you like to hear more information?"
    return {
        "speech": speech,
        "displayText": speech,
        # "data": data,
        # "contextOut": [],
        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }
```


Performs a basic calculation to determine if a user's policy has decreased or increased in value over time. If the rate of return for the last rolling month is less than the user's overall rate of return, we say 
that the user's rate of return has decreased. Otherwise, it has increased.

### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
req | The request JSON. We obtain parameters <code>userID</code>  from the request.



## lifeInsurancePolicyBreakdown

```python
def lifeInsurancePolicyBreakdown(req):

    parameters = req.get("result").get("parameters")
    userID = int(parameters.get("userID"))

    overallROR = getOverallReturnRate(userID)
    lastMonthROR = getLastMonthReturnRate(userID)
    internationInvestment = getInternationInvestment(userID)
    internationalROR = getInternationalROR(userID)

    rorDifference = lastMonthROR - overallROR
    
    print(rorDifference)
    if rorDifference < 0:
        speech = "Your return rate has decreased by " + str(rorDifference) + " percent over the past month relative to your overall rate of return. You have invested " + str(internationInvestment) + " dollars in international markets, the rate of return of these funds has fallen " + str(internationalROR) + " percent."

    else:
        speech = "Your return rate has increased by " + str(rorDifference) + " percent over the past month relative to your overall rate of return. You have invested " + str(internationInvestment) + " dollars in international markets, this having a rate of return of " + str(internationalROR) + " percent."

    speech = speech.replace('-', "")
    speech += " Would you like to set up an appointment with an agent?"
    return {
        "speech": speech,
        "displayText": speech,
        # "data": data,
        # "contextOut": [],
        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }
 ```

 idea maybe show how each method relates to speeech.


The method <code>lifeInsurancePolicy</code> will ask the user if they want to hear more information regarding life insurance. If they agree, this method is called. Uses <code>db.py</code> methods <code>getOverallReturnRate(userID)</code> <code>getLastMonthReturnRate(userID)</code> 
<code>getInternationInvestment(userID)</code> and <code>getInternationalROR(userID)</code> to retrieve the overall rate of return, last month's rate of return, international investments, and international rate of return respectively and provide this data to the user.

### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
req | The request JSON. We obtain parameters <code>userID</code>  from the request.


## notifications

```python
def notifications(req):
    parameters = req.get("result").get("parameters")
    userID = int(parameters.get("userID"))

    notifications = getNotifications(userID)
    print(notifications)

    numOfNotifs = getNumberOfNotifications(userID)

    speech = "Looks like you have " + str(numOfNotifs) + " notifications. "
    
    for i in range (0, numOfNotifs):
        speech += "Number " + str(i+1) + ": "
        speech += str(notifications[i]) + " "

    deleteThese = "()\'\""
    for char in deleteThese:
        speech = speech.replace(char, "")

    speech = speech.replace(",", ".")
    speech += "would you like to review your payment due?"
    #print(speech)
    return {
        "speech": speech,
        "displayText": speech,
        # "data": data,
        # "contextOut": [],
        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }
```

Retrives user notifications from the database. 




### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
req | The request JSON. We obtain parameters <code>userID</code>  from the request.



## verifyPinFufillRequest

```python
def verifyPinFufillRequest(req):
    parameters = req.get("result").get("parameters")

    userID = int(parameters.get("userID"))
    pin = (parameters.get("mypin"))
    pin = str(pin)

    #hash the pin
    pin.encode('utf-8')
    encryptedPin = hashlib.sha512(pin.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    encryptedPin = str(encryptedPin)

    #compare hashed pin to pin from database (use query)
    databasePin = getHashedUserPin(userID)
    databasePin = str(databasePin)

    if databasePin == encryptedPin:
        #print("TRUE")

        speech = "Okay. Acquiring your secrets. One moment"

    else:
        speech = "Incorrect Pin. Returning to main menu."
    return{
        "speech": speech,
        "displayText": speech,
        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }
```

<aside class="warning">Method not used in current version.</aside>

As a concept, if the user is going to access something otherwise confidential, they would speak or type a pin into their assistant.
We get the pin number the user gave the assistant through the <code>mypin</code> parameter in the JSON. We hash this pin 
using the same hash used for the database pin, and compare the incoming pin versus the db pin. If they are equal, we carry out user's request. 


<br>


### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
req | The request JSON. We obtain parameters <code>userID</code> and <code>mypin</code> from the request.


## dbReset

```python
def dbReset(req):
    os.system('python db_build_remote.py')
    speech = "The database has been reset!"
    return {
        "speech": speech,
        "displayText": speech,
        # "data": data,
        # "contextOut": [],
        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }
```

This is a special function created for demo purposes to reset database. 

<aside class="warning">This function is not meant to satisfy any particular use case regarding the project. This is only for demo purposes; to yield the same experience each round of the demo. </aside>




## initialize 

```python 
def initialize(req):
    os.system('python db_build_remote.py')
    speech = "Hello! I have some important updates regarding your Nationwide accounts. Would you like to hear it?"
    return {
        "speech": speech,
        "displayText": speech,
        # "data": data,
        # "contextOut": [],
        "source": "Nationwide-financial-assistant"
    }    
```

(Re)Initializes the database and assistant after the reset.
